# portfolio_analysis

I have created sample codes using the Kenneth R.French Data Library to explain that you can analyse the return attribution relating to Fama French,CAPM models along with Style analysis attribution where a sample portfolio can be seen as a distributed weights to industry factors.

Also as the history suggests as thousands of reserach paper shows that Equal weight has outperformed capital weighted index most of the times.

I have done this for industry based cap/equal weighted index.

Stay tuned i will be adding a lot more going forward for portfolio analysis and allocation.
